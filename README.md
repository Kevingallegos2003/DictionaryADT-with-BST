The Order program
Order.cpp            | Uses the Dictionary ADT (Dictionary.h) to be able to organize input into a BST.
Dictionary.cpp       | All Functions created from the prototypes in Dictionary.h
DictionaryTest.cpp   | Testing file used to test functions from Dictionary.cpp all tests are outputed on the line
Dictionary.h         | Prototypes of functions that will be used in the Dictionary program
Makefile             | Compiles and Makes the Order program as well as other testing code optionally
Note: When using equals it works properly in test but in client it doesnt? huh?
